        <h1>Stay Fit</h1>
            <p>Cardiovascular activity, which includes running, swimming, and cycling, works out your heart and lungs. With heart attacks rampant and on the rise working out your heart and lungs is extremely important!

            <p>Strength training is also extremely important as it allows you to build muscle mass and strengthen your core. Not only can it help you have better posture, but it can prevent injuries from occurring.</p>

            <h3>Tip for making exercise more enjoyable </h3>
            <p>Think about activities that you enjoy and how you can incorporate them into an exercise routine. Watch TV as you ride a stationary bike, chat with a friend as you walk, take photographs on a scenic hike, walk the golf course instead of using a cart, or dance to music as you do household chores.</p>
